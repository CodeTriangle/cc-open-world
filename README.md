# CC-Open-World

This mod patches a lot of events in the game, in order to remove the story and freely roam as long as you have the access to certain areas. This is mostly meant to be played with Randomizers like [CC-Item-Randomizer](https://github.com/CCDirectLink/CCItemRandomizer), or [CCMultiworldRandomizer](https://github.com/CodeTriangle/CCMultiworldRandomizer) integration for Archipelago, though it isn't required to use any of them to play around with this mod.

# What does it change

There's a lot of vital patches that change how things work in terms of story and content, so certain areas are completely locked (either from specific questlines, or just entirely locked), or already unlocked from other methods. There's a small info [Guide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buanjautista/cc-open-world/main/GUIDE) you can reference to know about these.

For more info on certain changes, you can check the [CHANGELOG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/buanjautista/cc-open-world/main/CHANGELOG)
