## Map patches for open world : ##

# Main:
Stats enabled in Rhombus Dungeon entrance (for NG+ purposes). 
Save fixes are entirely removed. Plot version starts in 5 to avoid save fix prompts in case they happen (which shouldn't).
Party window enabled in CrossCentral. You can now invite/manage party members as soon as certain events: 
- Only Apollo 3 duel is active, which unlocks him and Joern as party members if you fight him
- Unlock Emilie on Rookie Harbor Intro
- Unlock C’tron on Maroon Tree quest
- Unlock Shizuka by fighting her in Old Hideout

# Rookie Harbor:
Intro with Emilie and Schneider now tied to “plot.autumnIntro” instead of “plot.line”

Guild Town is open only after meeting Schneider for the first time, with him giving you the Guild Pass.

# Bergen:
No Apollo 1 sequence
Bergen Mine Entrance not locked by being past plotline (just needs Mine Pass)
Bergen Elevator passage to Maroon Valley not locked by plotline
Guild entry plot sequence now tied to its own plot.line ("plot.guildEntry"). This is enabled after obtaining Mine Pass.

# Maroon Valley:
Ba’kii kum Eldress quest now tied to its own plotline ("plot.heatLine" instead of “plot.line”)
Can invite C’tron to party for Maroon Tree quest, or look for him next to West Entrance where he usually is (up until finishing the Maroon Tree quest)
No Apollo 2 sequence before Faj’ro
Forced Maroon Tree pass to enter Maroon Tree 
Forced C’tron and Emilie when returning the Maroon Tree quest until you claim the Sand Shade reward

# Fajro Temple:
No logout or party member lock after Faj’ro temple
Disabled the cutscene when you enter the cross room in ground floor
Removed the movement from cutscene when you enter Cold Room so people dont get softlock by entering from different entrances
Change in a room in G-Room8 to not allow people exiting the map early (which otherwise leads to softlock / perma battle).

# Autumn’s Fall:
Added a Green Leaf Shade barrier on Autumn’s Rise entrance (to make the leaf shade slightly more useful later on)
Sapphire Ridge entrance is not locked anymore until post-kryskajo events
Gaias Garden entrance is not locked anymore until post-vermillion events
Finishing seed shade quest does not forces you to do the raid
Can’t start first raid on Autumn’s Fall to prevent Vermillion plot

# Vermillion Wasteland:
Tunnel entrance to Vermillion initially open
Exit back to Sapphire Ridge also enabled in cliff-1
Vermillion Tower entrance initially open (need to set up some custom blockades or something)
Stealth section is locked after the basement area to prevent entering tower from other than the main entrance

# Gaia’s Garden:
Chief’s House entrance area not locked
Chief’s House inside locked so you dont go down for stick quest 
Basin Keep has no story plot (neither beta pass)
Optional Apollo 3 fight, finishing it allows you to invite Apollo and Joern to party (plus a lot of questionable expression changes to fit the no-vermillion mood)
Shock Dungeon and Wave Dungeon accessible without party members or story locks
Removed stick quest plotline on zir’vitar entrance
Both shad barriers are gone, and Rite of Passage is initially open
Krys’kajo entrance doesnt require/change party members, or story progress. (still needs Drop and Bolt shade)

# Sapphire Ridge:

You can invite Shizuka after fighting her in Old Hideout
Entrance to Rhombus Square now linked to Meteor Shade

# Keys / Dungeons / Expo Spaces:
No race tracking for dungeons
End cutscenes not tied to having party members
Thief Key and White Key fights entrance barrier not locked when you finish fight (but the exit still requires getting the new key chest for logic reasons)
Expo space maps not tied to plot.line but to dungeon completion
(plot.cold-dng-end, plot-heat-dng-end, plot-daft-frobbit-kill, plot.shock-dng-end, plot.wave-dng-end)

# Quests
Subsequent quests in factions, are now unlocked depending on shades, rather than dungeon / plot completion

==========================================================================================

## EXTRA PATCHES ##

You can activate these patches from the Randomizer menu in CCItemRandomizer, or through the .yaml settings in the CCMultiworldRandomizer

# Vermillion Tower Shade and Boss lock:
- A condition that locks Vermillion Tower entrance until you get all 4 element shades (Azure Drop, Purple Bolt, Blue Ice, and Red Flame Shades), and beaten the 4 element dungeons (Mine, Faj'ro, So'najiz and Zir'vitar). 

# Vermillion Tower floor skips:
- Enables all Tower floors once you finish the ground floor fight. This allows skipping the entirety of Vermillion Tower up to the last fight before the boss

# Open Faj'ro Temple:
- Enables a few extra doors on Upper Faj'ro Temple to make it less linear.

# Meteor Shade Wasteland:
- Locks Vermillion Wasteland Tunnel behind a Meteor Shade barrier.
