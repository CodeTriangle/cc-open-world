## Starter info ##

There's a few important story-tied events that change in order to make Open World have a little more freedom. The content can be done in any order and shouldn't be tied to doing most events in story order, at least per area. 

# Important changes #
- Vermillion Wasteland is open as soon as you gain access to Sapphire Ridge. The passage is on the Old Dojo right side, where the hidden passage is normally. If you're using the Meteor Shade Wasteland lock, you'll also need that shade to get there. 
- To unlock the Guild Area, you will need to get a D-Link in Bergen North (from Emilie or Schneider), after obtaining the Mine Pass. This makes him (and Emilie if she's not in your party) appear in Old Obelisk in Autumn's Rise, who gives you the item check for the Guild Pass, which also enables access to the Guild Area.
- Temple Mine only needs Mine Pass to enter, and isn't tied to meeting with the guild.
- Maroon Tree requires meeting with the Eldress in Ba'kii Kum, obtaining the Maroon Tree Pass, and inviting C'tron in your party (which you can invite after speaking with the Eldress, or meet with him in the usual map).
- Rhombus Square will be accessible through CrossCentral, as soon as you obtain Meteor Shade.
- Old Hideout is always accessible on the Northern Sapphire Ridge, as long as you have Meteor Shade, and no members in your party. This is only to obtain Shizuka as a party member / contact.
- Old Dojo needs to have the first step of Golden Bugs quest active, and the Key to grant access to it.

Certain quests will be tied to getting shades instead of dungeon progress. This is:
- Getting Red Flame Shade to unlock the third set of quests in Rookie Harbor, and the second set of quests in Ba'kii Kum
- Getting Blue Ice Shade to unlock the second set of quests in Bergen Village
- Getting Red Flame Shade and Blue Ice Shade for Master Sensei quests in 

# Extra Patches #
These are small patches that you can add to your runs, to slightly modify some places in order to add more variety to the Open World.
