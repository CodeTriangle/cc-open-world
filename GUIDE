## Starter info ##

There's a few important story-tied events that change in order to make Open World have a little more freedom. The content can be done in any order and shouldn't be tied to doing most events in story order, at least per area. 

# Important changes #
- Vermillion Wasteland is open as soon as you gain access to Sapphire Ridge. The passage is on the Old Dojo right side, where the hidden passage is normally. If you're using the Meteor Shade Wasteland lock, you'll also need that shade to get there. 
- To unlock the Guild Area, you will need to get a D-Link in Bergen North (from Emilie or Schneider), after obtaining the Mine Pass. This makes him (and Emilie if she's not in your party) appear in Old Obelisk in Autumn's Rise, who gives you the item check for the Guild Pass, which also enables access to the Guild Area.
- Temple Mine only needs Mine Pass to enter, and isn't tied to meeting with the guild.
- Maroon Tree requires meeting with the Eldress in Ba'kii Kum, obtaining the Maroon Tree Pass, and inviting C'tron in your party (which you can invite after speaking with the Eldress).
- Old Hideout is always accessible on the Northern Sapphire Ridge, as long as you have Meteor Shade, and no members in your party. This is only to obtain Shizuka as a party member / contact.

# Extra Patches #
These are small patches that you can add to your runs, to slightly modify some places in order to add more variety to the Open World.
